# filemap

File size visualiser using the Squarified Treemap method ([pdf](http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf)).

## Building

### Linux
```
make
```

## Use
Run ./filemap [name  of folder]

Pan the map by clicking and dragging the mouse.
The name and size of the hovered-over file is displayed.
Scolling travels up the tree and displays ancestors.
Scrolling while holding down click will zoom in/out.

## TODO
* Scanning could be _much_ faster
* UI improvements
